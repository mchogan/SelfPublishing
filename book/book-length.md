Book Length
===========
One of the big questions I found myself asking was how long the book should be.

Role Models
-----------
For a reader, book length equates to reading time. Since I am editing a nonfiction book, I decided to investigate the reading times of popular nonfiction books that I admire and a few articles from high quality news publications.

### Remote

I really enjoyed Rework by the Basecamp team (formerly 37Signals). Since I assumed they probably learned from the success of Rework, I decided to put sample chapters for their follow up book, Remote, through a reading time calculator. Here are the times I calculated using iA Writer's built in reading time calculator that seems to be based on ~190 words per minute:

1:57 min.
1:34 min.
0:58 min.
2:38 min.
2:06 min.
2:55 min.

Here is the longest chapter:

### Creative Confidence
I also tried this on Creative Confidence, the latest book on design from IDEO. Their chapter is about 37 minutes long, broken into 4-6 minute sections.


### New York Times
The top three most emailed NYT articles on January 11th, 2014 measured, in order of email volume:

44:33 min. (but in chunks of about <1 min. each)
2:58 min.
3:57 min.

So, there seems to be a pattern here... Of course, I'm going to be careful not to "replicate" this approach without taking into account the uniqueness and differences between the books and the type of material being presented.

Economics
---------
Another consideration in book length is the economics of book production and distribution. Paper books have a much different per page cost than digital books. For paper books, the physical size of the book is important to the reader because a book has to be carried around and held during reading. Illustrations may add cost to both paper books, impacting printing costs, and digital books, impacting file sizes.

Applying this to my book
------------------------
From the reading time analysis I created a bathroom break heuristic: a person should be able to consume a usable chunk of a nonfiction book in the time it takes for a bathroom break. This will allow the book to be consumed in pieces that fit the reader's life. There will be breaks in line at the grocery store, breaks at the airport, breaks in the restroom, breaks during the work day, lunch, and thirty minutes to read in the evening. During each of these slices of time, the reader should be able to fully consume a concept from the book.

As a bonus, I realized these reading time durations look a lot like YouTube video durations, which also tend to be 2-5 minutes. I realized that these small chunks of content would make it easier for readers to share the passages they enjoy with friends and coworkers, making it more likely that pieces of the book might go viral.

Chapter 4 of my book was roughly 7,500 words, or a reading time of 57 minutes. So, I read through the chapter and organized it into 10-15 independently consumable ideas that each take 2-5 minutes to read. I made sure that each piece included a clear heading.

Repurposing unused content
--------------------------
In order to make a readable book, content needed to be cut. In some cases that content was useful. Rather than throw it away, I used it to create my book website, online resources, and downloadable supplements. In many cases, I found this simplified passages in the book and the online content was easier to use in an online format. I also increased the Google friendliness of the book by making more content findable on the web.

Tools
-----
Many tools have built in reading time calculators. I used iA Writer to investigate the reading times of the book passages and articles listed above. I also used Scrivener to track word count.
